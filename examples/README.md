## Running samples

For install and run these tests, first install [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) open source ecosystem for IoT development compatible with **Arduino** IDE and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux). Also, you may need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) in your system.

For compile and install each sample, only choose one of them envs names in the table, and run the next command in the root of this project, like this:

```bash
pio run -e m5cores3-espnow-receiver --target upload
```

Some examples, *.ino samples, only needs run `pio run --target upload` into each directory
